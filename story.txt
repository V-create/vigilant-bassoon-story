Kevin wake up. It seems to be really strange that his phone is not ringing to alert him. He takes his phone to check, and finds out that it has running out of battery. Moreover, he then realizes that there is no electricity in the whole city. All technologies have becomes useless, and people are back into the ancient state. It also turns out that birds and humans turned into rocks with a mysterious green light. 3700 years later, one mad scientist wakes up from slumber to re-revolutionize the stone world.
He builds a team in order to turn the stones back into humans and birds. He
finds all of the best scientists around the world and brings them to his 
lab to fix this mess. They worked for months trying to figure out what was 
happening.
 Finally, after 4 months of researching a solution, Seth, a 
scientist from Russia found the solution. He was just hanging out in a
cave somehwhere when he noticed that there was nitric acid dripping from
the cieling and breaking the petrification. It was a very lucky discovery.
The rest of the people were called and asked for a solution. But, they came up with the solution that none of them would even try to restore the humanity. It is human who made themselves into this state, and the responsibility should be taken by human, rather than given endless second chances.
